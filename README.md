### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I actually performed this task without having access to internet so it was quite an adventure adding the google fonts from the computers drive since I always have used the linked. It was a very good remainder of how to do it.

Also it was quite a good exercise to practice the nth-of-type pseudo-class to change colors and values individually on each of the categories in the section.

### Continued development

I still need to keep improving the responsive web design in general. I like when the design does not have to use media queries and when the it is behaves like a fluid disregarding screen size.
